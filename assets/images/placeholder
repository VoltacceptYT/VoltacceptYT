This document is designated as a temporary file for the directory assets/images. 
Its purpose is to serve as a placeholder, indicating the intended storage location for image assets within the project's directory structure. 
This placeholder file helps maintain the organization and recognition of the directory throughout the development lifecycle. 
By having a placeholder, it enhances the visual representation of the project's organization. 
It also ensures that the directory is preserved during any file operations such as copying or moving. 

As the project progresses, this file should be replaced or updated with actual images. 
Maintaining a well-organized directory is essential for efficient asset management. 
This, in turn, contributes to overall productivity and workflow efficiency. 
A clear and well-defined structure minimizes the risk of errors and saves valuable time. 
Effective organization is fundamental to successful project execution.
